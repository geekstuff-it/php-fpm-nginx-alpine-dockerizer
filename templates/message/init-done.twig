# Init done. About to let you handle the rest!
{%  if is_empty %}
Will drop to a shell to let you create a new php project and dockerize it.
{% else %}
Will drop to a shell where you can dockerize your php app.
{% endif %}

{%  if not has_framework %}
## Use php framework installers (if needed)
Here are some versions of tools if installed, or the commands to install them.
{% for app in apps %}
  {{ app.name }}: {{ app.version }}
{% endfor %}

Tips:
  - if running `symfony new`, use --no-git to avoid having to setup your git identity in this disposable "init" docker run.
{% endif %}

## Dockerize your app!
Latest dockerizer just got installed. (https://github.com/geekstuff-it/php-fpm-nginx-alpine-dockerizer)

This tool will create a few files if they don't exist, that will dockerize your php app into a php-fpm box and
an nginx box, both fully self-contained and as lean as possible, while also giving you a dev build with xdebug and more.

`php-dockerize` (use --help for options)
