## Install a PHP framework, or not.
Install any php framework, or none. You have a chance to use this php environment to run php installer.
For now this is tailored to symfony but will adapt to more ways.

Some tools and installers are already present in the box to help you get started.
{% for app in apps %}
  {{ app.name }}: {{ app.version }}
{% endfor %}

### Symfony installation example
```
/app$ symfony new --no-git .
/app$ symfony new --full --no-git .
/app$ symfony new --demo --no-git .
```
* The --no-git will make symfony skip auto creating a commit. Better to do that and other git operations
  from your host computer which is more likely setup with your git identity already.
{% endif %}

{%  if not is_dockerized %}
## Dockerize your app
Once you have generated your framework files or a plain composer init, use `php-dockerize` to generate the few files
needed to have a nice php environment for dev as well as a nice prod stage build, and docker-compose to simplify
running php-fpm and nginx in both a mounted way and a fully copied code way, all kept lean.

For now it is fixed to symfony, but we would like to add laravel, simple composer project, and framework-less apps too.

See `php-dockerize --help`, otherwise the defaults are safe to go with and uses latest fixed versioning.
